# Lumos: Detect Overload and Congestion in LTE/5G Networks

Lumos is a scalable data capture and analysis platform capable of quantifying overload and congestion in cellular networks without cooperation from service providers.

Lumos is based on the idea that third-party assessment tools should be accessible to the community and carry a low hardware footprint. The platform has been tested on USRP B210 devices.
